description: Search previous Claude Code conversations for facts, patterns, decisions, and context using semantic or text search. Use when Michelle mentions "we discussed this before", when debugging similar issues, when looking for architectural decisions or code patterns from past work, before reinventing solutions, or when finding specific git SHAs or error messages.
when_to_use: When Michelle says "we discussed this before". When debugging similar issues. When looking for past architectural decisions. When searching for code patterns from previous work. Before reinventing solutions. When finding specific git SHAs or error messages.

# Remembering Conversations

Search archived conversations using semantic similarity or exact text matching.

**Core principle:** Search before reinventing.

**Announce:** "I'm searching previous conversations for [topic]."

**Setup:** See INDEXING.md

## When to Use

**Search when:**
- Your human partner mentions "we discussed this before"
- Debugging similar issues
- Looking for architectural decisions or patterns
- Before implementing something familiar

**Don't search when:**
- Info in current conversation
- Question about current codebase (use Grep/Read)

## In-Session Use

**Always use subagents** (50-100x context savings). See skills/getting-started for workflow.

**Manual/CLI use:** Direct search (below) for humans outside Claude Code sessions.

## Direct Search (Manual/CLI)

**Tool:** `~/.claude/skills/collaboration/remembering-conversations/tool/search-conversations`

**Modes:**
```bash
search-conversations "query"              # Vector similarity (default)
search-conversations --text "exact"       # Exact string match
search-conversations --both "query"       # Both modes
```

**Flags:**
```bash
--after YYYY-MM-DD    # Filter by date
--before YYYY-MM-DD   # Filter by date
--limit N             # Max results (default: 10)
--help                # Full usage
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Semantic search
search-conversations "React Router authentication errors"

# Find git SHA
search-conversations --text "a1b2c3d4"

# Time range
search-conversations --after 2025-09-01 "refactoring"
```

Returns: project, date, conversation summary, matched exchange, similarity %, file path.

**For details:** Run `search-conversations --help`
